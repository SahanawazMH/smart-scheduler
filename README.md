## 🧠 Core Algorithm Explained

The "brain" of the application is a `TimetableService` class that uses a **multi-stage heuristic process**:

1. **Initialization:** Loads all data and constraints from the database into memory.  
2. **Class Pool Creation:** Builds a master list of every single 1-hour session that needs to be scheduled.  
3. **Intelligent Placement Engine:** Iterates through every class in the pool, systematically searching for a valid slot by running a series of critical conflict checks:  
   - ✅ Teacher, Room, and Section availability  
   - ✅ Teacher unavailability constraints  
   - ✅ Continuous class counter (prevents >4 hours of continuous classes)  
   - ✅ Protected lunch break window  
4. **Saving & Reporting:** Successful placements are saved to the database, and any unschedulable classes are returned in a conflict report.
